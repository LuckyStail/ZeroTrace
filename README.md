## Reporting

    ZeroTrace generates detailed reports in multiple formats:

    JSON: Machine-readable format for further analysis.
    HTML: Human-readable format for viewing in a browser.
    PDF: Portable format suitable for sharing.

    Reports are automatically generated and saved in the scan_results/ directory after each scan. You can customize the report generation by modifying the report_generator.py script


## Conclusion

    ZeroTrace is a powerful, modular, and easy-to-use automated penetration testing system. It integrates various scanning and exploitation tools into a unified platform, providing an efficient and streamlined process for vulnerability discovery and exploitation.

    By generating comprehensive reports in multiple formats, it simplifies the documentation process for penetration testers, making it an invaluable tool for both manual and automated testing.
